                   COSE "typ" (type) Header Parameter
              draft-ietf-cose-typ-header-parameter-latest

Abstract

   This specification adds the equivalent of the JSON Object Signing and
   Encryption (JOSE) typ (type) header parameter to CBOR Object Signing
   and Encryption (COSE).  This enables the benefits of explicit typing,
   as defined in the JSON Web Token Best Current Practices BCP, to be
   brought to COSE objects.  The syntax of the COSE type header
   parameter value is the same as the existing COSE content type header
   parameter.

1.  Introduction

   CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) [RFC9052] defines header
   parameters that parallel many of those defined by the JSON Object
   Signing and Encryption (JOSE) [RFC7515] [RFC7516] specifications.
   However, one way in which COSE does not provide equivalent
   functionality to JOSE is that it does not define an equivalent of the
   typ (type) header parameter, which is used for declaring the type of
   the entire JOSE data structure.  The security benefits of having typ
   (type) are described in Section 3.11 of the JSON Web Token Best
   Current Practices [RFC8725], which recommends its use for "explicit
   typing" -- using typ values to distinguish between different kinds of
   JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519].

   This specification adds the equivalent of the JOSE typ (type) header
   parameter to COSE so that the benefits of explicit typing can be
   brought to COSE objects.  The syntax of the COSE type header
   parameter value is the same as the existing COSE content type header
   parameter, allowing both unsigned integer CoAP Content-Formats
   [IANA.CoAP.ContentFormats] values and string Media Type
   [IANA.MediaTypes] values to be used.

   The term "COSE object" is used as defined in [RFC9052].  An example
   of a COSE object is a COSE_Sign1 structure, as described in
   Section 4.2 of [RFC9052].

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  COSE "typ" (type) header parameter

   The typ (type) header parameter is used by COSE applications to
   declare the type of this complete COSE object, as compared to the
   content type header parameter, which declares the type of the COSE
   object payload.  This is intended for use by the application when
   more than one kind of COSE object could be present in an application
   data structure that can contain a COSE object; the application can
   use this value to disambiguate among the different kinds of COSE
   objects that might be present.  It will typically not be used by
   applications when the kind of COSE object is already known.  Use of
   this header parameter is OPTIONAL.

   The syntax of this header parameter value is the same as the content
   type header parameter defined in Section 3.1 of [RFC9052]; it is
   either an unsigned integer CoAP Content-Formats
   [IANA.CoAP.ContentFormats] value or a string Content Type value.
   Content Type values have a Media Type name [IANA.MediaTypes] and MAY
   include Media Type parameters.

   This parameter is ignored by COSE implementations (libraries
   implementing [RFC9052] and this specification), other than being
   passed through to applications using those implementations.  Any
   processing of this parameter is performed by the COSE application
   using application-specific processing rules.  For instance, an
   application might verify that the typ value is a particular
   application-chosen media type and reject the data structure if it is
   not.

   The typ parameter MUST NOT be present in unprotected headers.

   The typ parameter does not describe the content of unprotected
   headers.  Changes to unprotected headers do not change the type of
   the COSE object.

3.  Security Considerations

   The case for explicit typing of COSE objects is equivalent to the
   case made for explicit typing in Section 3.11 of JSON Web Token Best
   Current Practices [RFC8725]: Explicit typing can prevent confusion
   between different kinds of COSE objects.

   COSE applications employing explicit typing should reject COSE
   objects with a type header parameter value different than values that
   they expect in that application context.  They should also reject
   COSE objects without a type header parameter when one is expected.

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  COSE Header Parameter Registrations

   This section registers the following value in the IANA "COSE Header
   Parameters" registry [IANA.COSE.HeaderParameters].

   *  Name: typ (type)
   *  Label: TBD (requested assignment 16)
   *  Value Type: uint / tstr
   *  Value Registry: [IANA.CoAP.ContentFormats] or [IANA.MediaTypes]
   *  Description: Type of the complete COSE object
   *  Reference: Section 2 of this specification
